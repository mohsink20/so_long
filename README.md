# So Long
And thanks for all the fish!

## Summary:
This project is a very small 2D game. Its purpose is to make you work with textures, sprites, and some other very basic gameplay elements.
- Version: 3

## I. Objectives
It’s time for you to create a basic computer graphics project! "so_long" will help you improve your skills in the following areas: window management, event handling, colors, textures, and so forth. You are going to use the school graphical library: the MiniLibX! This library was developed internally and includes basic necessary tools to open a window, create images and deal with keyboard and mouse events. The other goals are similar to every other goal for this first year: being rigorous, level up in C programming, use basic algorithms, do some information research, and so forth.

## II. Common Instructions
- Your project must be written in C.
- Your project must be written in accordance with the Norm. If you have bonus files/functions, they are included in the norm check and you will receive a 0 if there is a norm error inside.
- Your functions should not quit unexpectedly (segmentation fault, bus error, double free, etc) apart from undefined behaviors. If this happens, your project will be considered non-functional and will receive a 0 during the evaluation.
- All heap allocated memory space must be properly freed when necessary. No leaks will be tolerated.
- If the subject requires it, you must submit a Makefile which will compile your source files to the required output with the flags -Wall, -Wextra and -Werror, use cc, and your Makefile must not relink.
- Your Makefile must at least contain the rules $(NAME), all, clean, fclean and re.
- To turn in bonuses to your project, you must include a rule bonus to your Makefile, which will add all the various headers, libraries or functions that are forbidden on the main part of the project. Bonuses must be in a different file _bonus.{c/h} if the subject does not specify anything else. Mandatory and bonus part evaluation is done separately.

## III. Mandatory part
### III.1 Game
- The player’s goal is to collect every collectible present on the map, then escape choosing the shortest possible route.
- The W, A, S, and D keys must be used to move the main character.
- The player should be able to move in these 4 directions: up, down, left, right.
- The player should not be able to move into walls.
- At every move, the current number of movements must be displayed in the shell.
- You have to use a 2D view (top-down or profile).
- The game doesn’t have to be real-time.
- Although the given examples show a dolphin theme, you can create the world you want. If you prefer, you can use ZQSD or the arrow keys on your keyboard to move your main character.

### III.2 Graphic management
- Your program has to display the image in a window.
- The management of your window must remain smooth (changing to another window, minimizing, and so forth).
- Pressing ESC must close the window and quit the program in a clean way.
- Clicking on the cross on the window’s frame must close the window and quit the program in a clean way.
- The use of the images of the MiniLibX is mandatory.

### III.3 Map
- The map has to be constructed with 3 components: walls, collectibles, and free space.
- The map can be composed of only these 5 characters: 0 for an empty space, 1 for a wall, C for a collectible, E for a map exit, P for the player’s starting position.
- The map must contain 1 exit, at least 1 collectible, and 1 starting position to be valid.
- If the map contains duplicate characters (exit/start), you should display an error message.
- The map must be rectangular.
- The map must be closed/surrounded by walls. If it’s not, the program must return an error.
- You have to check if there’s a valid path in the map.
- You must be able to parse any kind of map, as long as it respects the above rules.

#### Example Maps:
1. A simple valid map:
   ```plaintext
   1111111111111
   10010000000C1
   1000011111001
   1P0011E000001
   1111111111111
   ```

2. Another example of a minimal .ber map:
   ```plaintext
   1111111111111111111111111111111111
   1E0000000000000C00000C000000000001
   1010010100100000101001000000010101
   1010010010101010001001000000010101
   1P0000000C00C0000000000000000000C1
   1111111111111111111111111111111111
   ```

- If any misconfiguration of any kind is encountered in the file, the program must exit in a clean way, and return "Error\n" followed by an explicit error message of your choice.

## IV. Bonus part
Usually, you would be encouraged to develop your own original extra features. However, there will be much more interesting graphic projects later. They are waiting for you!! Don’t lose too much time on this assignment!
- You are allowed to use other functions to complete the bonus part as long as their use is justified during your evaluation. Be smart!
- You will get extra points if you:
  - Make the player lose when they touch an enemy patrol.
  - Add some sprite animation.
  - Display the movement count directly on the screen instead of writing it in the shell.
- You can add files/folders based on bonuses as needed.

## V. Submission and peer-evaluation
Turn in your assignment in your Git repository as usual. Only the work inside your repository will be evaluated during the defense. Don’t hesitate to double-check the names of your files to ensure they are correct. As these assignments are not verified by a program, feel free to organize your files as you wish, as long as you turn in the mandatory files and comply with the requirements.
